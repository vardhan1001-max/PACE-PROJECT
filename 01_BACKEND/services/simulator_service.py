=====================
Retention Action Simulator.

IMPORTANT — READ BEFORE TRUSTING A NUMBER FROM THIS MODULE
------------------------------------------------------------
This dataset has no A/B test or experiment log of retention offers actually
being sent to customers, so there is no causal/uplift model anywhere in this
project that measures what an action really does to churn probability.
ACTIONS below is therefore a documented table of CONFIGURABLE BUSINESS
ASSUMPTIONS (a cost and an assumed churn-probability-point reduction per
action), not a learned effect. Every result this module returns must be
presented as a "scenario estimate based on configurable assumptions" — never
as a guarantee that an action will reduce churn.

The churn probability and customer value it starts from ARE real (the
existing churn model's ChurnProbability and EstimatedAnnualSpendINR).
